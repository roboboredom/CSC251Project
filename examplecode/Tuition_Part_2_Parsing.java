        an IOException will be "thrown" and we can "catch" it and deal with the problem. By taking this approach instead of adding a "throws IOException" clause to the main method header, we can 
        gracefully handle problems related to reading the file without having our program crash. If a problem occurs while processing the file, the IOException is immediately "thrown", the code 
        immediately jumps to the "catch" block of code. The message in the "catch" block will display. */
